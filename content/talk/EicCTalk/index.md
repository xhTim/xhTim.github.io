summary: A presentation on my work of the physics simulation at the Polarized Electron-Ion Collider in China.
abstract: "The hadronization mechanism of heavy quarks is an interesting topic to study. In my presentation, I report my work on the physics simulations at the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC). By simulation and signal reconstruction, I obtain the heavy quark baryon-to-meson ratio distribution as a function of charged track multiplicity and compare the result with that of Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), which gives the statistics that will be measured at EicC and provides a proof that EicC will cover a different kinematic region compared to EIC. In addition, the results of particles, antiparticles and their sum are compared."
